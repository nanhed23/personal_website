      <h4>
      Hi! My name is Jenjira Holmes. I am a 4th year Architecture student at UCLA, double minoring in Environmental Studies and Geographic Information Systems. I was slowly exposed to the realm of Computer Science and Programming since my Freshman year at UCLA,but not until recently that I decided to take my interest in this field seriously. My interests are Frontend Web Development and geocoding.
